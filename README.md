### :wave: Hi there

This is the place where most of my passion projects are stored

- :zap: &nbsp; I have a Bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering and Robotics (Electrical Engineering)
- :computer: &nbsp; I'm currently working as a software developer for machine PLCs
- :seedling: &nbsp; I'm actively learning Rust &amp; Nix in my free time
- :floppy_disk: &nbsp; I'm currently working on setting up my homelab using NixOS

### âœ¨ About Me

I am a programming hobbyist having studied Electrical Engineering for 3.5 years just to end up doing programming anyways :sweat_smile: (now for big machines though :smile:)

### My Opensource Story

- [hsc-template](https://github.com/btoschek/hsc-template) - A LaTeX template used in creating scientific documents to hand in for assignments at university.
  Within a couple months it became widely used among students and got recommended by multiple professors.
  As of September 5th, 2024 it is being [officially continued by UAS Coburg](https://github.com/hscoburg/FEIF-thesis-and-report-template).
- [lorelei](https://github.com/btoschek/lorelei) - A Discord bot used to provide a customized music streaming experience to me and my friends.
  This is probably the first bigger project I have done in Rust. And it's still going!
- :telescope: Hopefully many more projects to come ...
